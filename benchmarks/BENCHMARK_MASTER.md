## Issue Resolution Summary

### Critical Bug Fixed
- **Error**: `Error: set is too large; use 'std/sets' for ordinal types with more than 2^16 elements`
- **Location**: `src/nimsync/numa.nim` in functions `sameNumaNode` and `detectNumaTopology`
- **Impact**: Prevented all benchmarks and examples from compiling
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### Resolution Details
The core issue was in the NUMA module where the code was using:
- `cpu1 in cpus` - creating large implicit sets in `sameNumaNode` function
- `var nodeSet: set[int]` - with potential for over 2^16 elements in `detectNumaTopology` function

## System Configuration

### Runtime Environment
- **Library**: nimsync - High-performance async runtime for Nim
- **Features**: Structured concurrency, lock-free channels, backpressure-aware streams, lightweight actors
- **Optimizations**: ORC memory management, threading enabled, release optimizations

### Compilation Settings
```bash
nim c -d:danger --opt:speed -r [benchmark_file]
```
- `--opt:speed` for maximum performance
- `--mm:orc` for optimal memory management
- `--threads:on` for concurrency support

---

## Benchmark Execution

### Method 1: Comprehensive Automated Runner
```bash
# Run all benchmarks with full logging and reporting
./scripts/run_all_benchmarks.sh
```

### Method 2: Individual Benchmark Execution
```bash
# Run specific benchmarks
nim c -d:danger --opt:speed -r benchmarks/channels_benchmark.nim
nim c -d:danger --opt:speed -r benchmarks/taskgroup_benchmark.nim
```

### Method 3: Nimble Tasks
```bash
# Using project tasks
nimble bench          # Run basic benchmarks
nimble testPerf       # Run performance tests
nimble testStress     # Run stress tests
```

### Method 4: Makefile Integration
```bash
# Using Makefile targets
make test-performance  # Run performance benchmarks
make test-stress      # Run stress tests
```

---

## Compilation Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `sameNumaNode` Function
**Before**:
```nim
if cpu1 in cpus and cpu2 in cpus:  # Creates large implicit set
```

**After**:
```nim
if cpus.contains(cpu1) and cpus.contains(cpu2):  # Uses sequence search
```

### 2. Fixed `detectNumaTopology` Function
**Before**:
```nim
var nodeSet: set[int]  # Limited to 2^16 elements
```

**After**:
```nim
var nodeSet = initHashSet[int]()  # Unlimited size via std/sets
```

### 3. Added Proper Imports
```nim
import std/[atomics, os, strutils, sets, cpuinfo]
import ./errors
import ./channels as ch
```

### 4. Platform-Specific Handling
```nim
when defined(linux):
  when declared(sched_getcpu):
    # Safe access to sched_getcpu
  else:
    # Fallback implementation
```

### 5. Resolved Circular Dependencies
- Used prefixed imports: `import ./channels as ch`
- Used fully qualified names where needed: `ch.Channel`, `ch.initChannel`
